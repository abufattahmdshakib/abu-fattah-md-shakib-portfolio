            <p className="text-white mt-4 text-lg md:mx-0 font-primary">I work with a deep passion for creating immersive and dynamic web applications. My journey in web development began as a detail-oriented Frontend Developer, driven by curiosity to craft visually appealing and user-friendly websites. Building on a strong foundation in JavaScript, React.js, and Next.js, I have now acquired full proficiency in the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.

                Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in UI/UX design, ensuring that every project not only meets but exceeds user expectations. From e-commerce platforms to dynamic web applications, I have successfully transformed complex concepts into elegant and functional designs. Proficient in modern frameworks such as React and Vue.js, I continuously work to create seamless and interactive user experiences.

                Collaboration is the core of my work ethic, where creativity and problem-solving converge. Effective communication is the key to successful projects, and I am always eager to share my experience and learn from others.

                As a continuous learner, I am committed to staying at the forefront of the ever-evolving world of web development. Whether experimenting with new technologies or improving my design skills, I always bring fresh perspectives and creative solutions.

                Beyond technical skills, I am dedicated to meeting deadlines, attentive to detail, and passionate about delivering high-quality work. I look forward to applying my frontend and MERN stack skills to exceed client expectations and bring innovative solutions.</p>
